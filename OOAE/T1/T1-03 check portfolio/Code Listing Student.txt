// I have set the Student variables "name" and "homeAddress, uniAddress" to be private static, so as to allow them to be accessed by the Address class
I originally tried something along the lines of "return (new Student().name)..." after some research online, however since this is calling the Student class constructor
it needed populating. I also tried to have a Student object passed into the Address toString method and calling Student.name, but this output memory locations of the variables
instead.

package innerclassesproj;

public class Student
{
    private static String name;
    private static Address homeAddress, uniAddress;
    
    public Student(String name, int houseNum, String homeStreet)
    {
        this.name = name;
        homeAddress = new Address(houseNum, homeStreet);
    }
    
    public void setUniAddress(Address uniAddress)
    {
        this.uniAddress = uniAddress;
    }
    
    public void setUniAddress(int hNum, String StrName)
    {
        uniAddress = new Address(hNum, StrName);
    }
    
    @Override
    public String toString()
    {
        if (homeAddress != null && uniAddress != null)
        {
        return "Home Address:\n" + homeAddress + "\n\nUni Address:\n" + uniAddress;
        }
        
        else if (homeAddress != null && uniAddress == null)
        {
            return "" + homeAddress;
        }
        
        else if (homeAddress == null && uniAddress != null)
        {
            return "" + uniAddress;
        }
