QUESTION1
=========

What is the advantage of implementing RaceCar as an inner class of RaceCarPanel?

ANSWER
======

If RaceCar is an inner class of RaceCarPanel, then they can both access everything inside each other, meaning RaceCar can 
populate the RaceCarPanel RaceCar Array
And RaceCarPanel can call the Display method found inside RaceCar. It also allows the RaceCarPanel to instantiate the Race 
cars when it is instantiated.

QUESTION2
=========

Why does RaceCarApplet implement the Runnable interface?  
In which class and method is the RaceCarApplet thread started?

ANSWER
======

RaceCarApplet implements the runnable interface because it creates a new thread on which to repaint the RaceCarPanel every 25 
milliseconds.
The RaceCarApplet thread is started in the Start() Method inside RaceCarApplet.java

QUESTION3
=========

In the RaceCarPanel method with the signature

private synchronized void goThroughNarrows(RaceCar rc)

what is the significance of the keyword synchronized?  
Try commenting out this keyword – what happens?

ANSWER
======

Synchronised stops any thread from entering that block of code (That method) until the current thread inside it has left that 
method and moved onto another.
Therefore RaceCars must wait until whichever RaceCar is currently going through the narrows has left, before they can enter. 
Without being synchronised they would all
essentially crash (Go through the narrows / the method at the same time)

QUESTION4
=========

Which RaceCarApplet method is called if the viewer moves to a new web page?  
Trace the method(s) called by this method – why is this code important?

ANSWER
======

The Stop method is called in RaceCarApplet whenever the viewer moves to a new web page. This in turn calls the stop method inside 
the RaceCarPanel and sets all of the threads inside there to null, before setting the repaint thread to null. 
Then the applet calls destroy.
This code is important because the threads are using resources otherwise, and there is no need to use those resources if you can't
see what they are doing (An animation doesn't need resources if you can't see it)
