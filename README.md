# Projects
A collection of projects created during my time at university.

It's important to note that many of these applications are prototypes or a proof of concept. They were also created to meet a specified mark scheme and specific learning outcomes 
which often didn't make a lot of sense in a genuine business application and often forced the use of functionality that wasn't necessary. Therefore many of these projects 
may seem incomplete.
